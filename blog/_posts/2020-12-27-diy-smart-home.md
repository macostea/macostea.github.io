# DIY Smart Home
About 2 years ago I started to work on a project I unimaginatively called "HomeManager". I was fascinated with small computers, sensors and the likes and I wanted to build my own smart home, whatever that meant.

I used this project to learn more about small computers, different programming languages, software architecture,  deployment methods and electronics in general, on top of having a cool project to work on whenever I was bored.

So I gathered all the unused small computers in my house and started hacking.

# The goals
This one was pretty easy:
* **Self-hosted data** - I wanted to store everything locally instead of using the public cloud
* **Scalable** - whatever I was building had to run locally on a Raspberry Pi, a cluster of Pis or in the public cloud if needed
* **Containers** - I work in DevOps so I was familiar with the benefits of using containers and wanted to use the same technology in this project as well
* **Integrated** - I was already the proud owner of some Philips Hue lights, a Google Home, a smart 4K TV, I wanted to integrate with these gadgets and other ones to build complex scenarios
* **Cheap** - I was not really looking to invest in expensive software, hardware or services; the more DIY, the better
* **Educational** - I wanted to use this project to learn about new things so stepping outside my comfort zone was very important

# About this series
The project has evolved a lot in the past 2 years and I'll try to remember the details and iterations for each part but I can't promise it's going to be a great write-up.

I do promise, however, that any new development starting now will be properly documented in this series. But until then, let's just catch up.
