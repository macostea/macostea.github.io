# Hi there!

My name is Mihai and I create awesome software. I am currently based in Romania, right in
the heart of Transylvania, in the city of [Cluj-Napoca](https://map.what3words.com/orders.lands.luring){:target="_blank"}.

I've worked with a lot of technologies since I started doing this. Here are a bunch of them, 
listed in no specific order (I'm not particularly good at SEO so I really hope listing these 
popular things will increase my ranking):

* iOS
    * Objective-C
    * Swift
    * C/C++
* Android OS development
    * C/C++
    * Java
* Web
    * Vue.js
    * jQuery
    * ES6
* Server-side
    * Python
    * Go
    * Node.js
    * Docker

Cool words, right? Anyway...

I love learning new things and working with talented people so I usually look for that
when accepting projects. I'm also very happy when I can help out other people so I try 
to do that as much as possible.

You can find some of the projects I've worked on in the [projects page](/projects).
